          I like the mountains -- they're my favorite. You have to make an almighty decision. Remember where your finger's been before you scratch your nose. Very gently go across the entire sky. See how easy that is? When the birds take over, I'll have friends! Make your own mind up about where your clouds should live. You'll be amazed at some of the effects you can achieve. I am a fanatic for water. Just sort of blend it around.

          Pretend you're a whisper floating across here. Mountains come in all shapes and sizes. There's nothing worse than an angry tree. Let your imagination wander around while you're doing these things. Everybody needs to sing in the sunshine! Enough of that. ...three hairs and some air... That'll be a challenge! Tell you what: let's get crazy today. We'll have a super time.
